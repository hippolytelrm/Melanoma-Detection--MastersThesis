# Melanoma detection and skin lesion classification

This repository contains some of the experiments I have implemented for my Master's Thesis on Melanoma Detection and Skin Cancer Classification. 

## Final report 

The file ```Masters_Thesis_final_report.pdf``` contains the pdf version of the final report. The summary is given below.

1. Introduction 
2. Skin cancer, a global health issue 
3. The International Skin Imaging Collaboration 
4. Binary skin lesion classification 
5. ISIC 2017 challenge 
6. Generating skin lesions images
7. Conclusion
